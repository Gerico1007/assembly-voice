### Key Enhancements to the AI Music Assistant Agent Plan

- **Modernize for MuseScore 4.x Compatibility**: Incorporate updates like using "dialog" plugin type instead of "dock," enclosing score modifications with `curScore.startCmd()` and `curScore.endCmd()`, and handling version-specific properties to ensure seamless operation across MuseScore versions.
- **Expand Command Capabilities**: Leverage the comprehensive MuseScore Plugin API to support advanced actions such as adding notes, chords, transpositions, time signature changes, and state querying, while addressing limitations like non-functional `readScore()` and `writeScore()` in version 4.x.
- **Integrate AI Best Practices**: Draw from existing AI tools like Klangio and NotaGen to add features for transcription and generation, emphasizing user control, ethical AI use, and iterative feedback to maintain creative ownership.
- **Enhance Security and State Management**: Implement secure WebSocket communication with authentication, and enable bidirectional state syncing so the agent can query the current score context (e.g., selected measures or key signatures) for more intuitive commands.
- **Refined Development Phases**: Add phases for security auditing, comprehensive testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), user beta testing, and scalability for multi-project support, aiming for a robust rollout.

#### Updated Architecture Overview
The enhanced architecture builds on the original by incorporating WebSocket security measures, such as token-based authentication to prevent unauthorized access, and bidirectional communication for real-time score state updates. This allows the agent to respond contextually, e.g., "Transpose the selected section up a fifth" without needing explicit user details each time. Use QML's built-in WebSocket support for the plugin, which provides properties like `active`, `status`, and methods for sending/receiving messages.

#### New Features and Integrations
Introduce AI-driven enhancements inspired by tools like Klangio (for audio-to-notation transcription) and NotaGen (for generative composition). For example, allow commands like "Generate a melody in C major based on this audio" by integrating backend AI models. Add error handling in the backend to parse LLM outputs safely, preventing invalid commands from reaching MuseScore. Frontend improvements include real-time feedback indicators in the chat interface, such as progress spinners during command execution.

#### Risk Mitigation and Best Practices
Address open questions: The MuseScore API is rich for core editing tasks but limited in batch file operations in version 4.x—mitigate by focusing on in-app edits. QML networking supports WebSockets fully, with no major limitations for local use. For state management, the plugin can serialize score data (e.g., via `curScore.selection.elements`) and send it back. Follow AI best practices by ensuring transparency (e.g., log AI decisions) and user overrides, promoting responsible integration where AI assists rather than replaces human creativity.

### Enhanced Feature Plan: AI Music Assistant Agent for MuseScore

This enhanced document refines the original plan by incorporating insights from MuseScore's latest plugin API (version 4.x as of 2025), QML WebSocket capabilities, and best practices from existing AI music tools like Klangio and NotaGen. The goal remains to create a seamless AI-powered assistant for composition and editing in MuseScore via natural language commands, but with added emphasis on compatibility, security, ethical AI use, and expanded functionality. Updates include addressing API limitations, improving state management, and adding new phases for testing and scalability.

#### 1. Summary

The integration of Assembly Voice with MuseScore will enable an AI agent to interpret natural language prompts and execute real-time edits within MuseScore projects. Enhancements include support for generative AI features (e.g., melody creation), audio transcription, and bidirectional communication for context-aware responses. This builds a more intelligent, user-centric tool that assists composers without overriding their creative control, aligning with best practices for AI in music production.

#### 2. User Story

As a music composer, I want to interact with an AI agent through a chat window for real-time assistance with musical scores in MuseScore. Examples include "Add a C major chord in the first measure," "Transpose this section up a perfect fifth," "Change the time signature to 3/4," or advanced requests like "Generate a Beethoven-style melody for strings" or "Transcribe this audio clip into notation." The agent should provide feedback on success, suggest alternatives if commands fail, and respect user overrides to maintain ethical AI collaboration.

#### 3. Proposed Architecture

The architecture retains the three core components but enhances them with security, AI integrations, and MuseScore 4.x compatibility:

1. **Assembly Voice Frontend**: The React-based chat interface sends user prompts to the backend and displays responses, now with added real-time status updates (e.g., "Command executing...") and error notifications. It can also handle file uploads for audio transcription.

2. **Musescore Plugin (New)**: Built using QML for MuseScore 4.x, acting as a bridge. It runs a secure WebSocket server, listens for commands, executes them via the Plugin API, and sends back score state or results. Use "dialog" type for compatibility, with optional UI panel for logs.

3. **Agent Backend (Node.js)**: Enhances `server.cjs` to process prompts with an LLM (e.g., Gemini or Grok), translate to JSON commands, manage secure WebSocket connections, and integrate AI models for generation/transcription. Add modules for state caching to enable context-aware responses.

##### Communication Flow
User Input (React Frontend) → Agent Backend (Node.js) → LLM for Intent Recognition and Command Formatting → Secure WebSocket to Musescore Plugin → MuseScore API Execution → Response/State Feedback via WebSocket → Backend Processing → Frontend Display.

To ensure security, implement token authentication in WebSocket handshakes. For state management, the plugin queries the current score (e.g., using `curScore.selection.elements` or `cursor.segment`) and sends serialized JSON back to the backend.

##### Key Technical Additions
- **AI Integrations**: Use APIs from tools like Klangio for audio-to-notation or NotaGen-inspired generation. Backend can call external services (e.g., via HTTP) for complex tasks.
- **Error Handling**: Backend validates LLM outputs against supported commands; plugin wraps executions in try-catch with `curScore.startCmd()` and `curScore.endCmd()` to manage undo/redo stacks.
- **Scalability**: Support multiple MuseScore instances by allowing port configuration in the plugin.

#### 4. Technical Implementation Details

##### Musescore Plugin
- **Language**: QML with JavaScript logic, compatible with MuseScore 4.x (Qt6).
- **Functionality**:
  - Starts a WebSocket server on a configurable local port (e.g., `localhost:12345`) using QML's WebSocket type, with properties like `active: true`, `url: "ws://localhost:12345"`, and handlers for `onTextMessageReceived` and `onStatusChanged`.
  - Processes incoming JSON commands, e.g., `{ "command": "addChord", "params": { "notes": ["C4", "E4", "G4"], "measure": 1 } }`, mapping to API calls like `newElement(Element.CHORD)` and `cursor.add(element)`.
  - Uses Plugin API for actions: Create notes/chords (`newElement`, `Cursor.add`), transpose (`cmd("transpose-up-fifth")`), change time signatures (`cursor.segment.timeSig`), add dynamics/symbols.
  - Queries and sends score state, e.g., current selection, key/time signatures, via `sendTextMessage(JSON.stringify(state))`.
  - Handles limitations: Avoid `readScore/writeScore` (non-functional in 4.x); use workarounds like exporting via internal commands if needed.
- **UI**: Add a dockable dialog panel (if supported in future updates) or floating window showing connection status, recent commands, and logs. Inspired by existing plugins like those on GitHub (e.g., element analyzer).

##### Agent Backend
- **Logic**:
  - New endpoint `/musescore-command` receives prompts, uses LLM with a refined system prompt: "Translate to JSON command, considering current score state: [state data]. Support generation/transcription."
  - Integrates AI models: For generation, prompt LLM to output ABC notation convertible to MuseScore elements; for transcription, proxy to Klangio API.
  - Manages WebSocket client with reconnection logic and authentication.
  - Caches score state for contextual LLM queries, updating on feedback.

- **QML Networking**: WebSockets are fully supported with no major limitations for local servers; examples confirm reliable message handling.
- **State Management**: Resolved via plugin querying API (e.g., `curScore` properties) and sending JSON state; backend caches for efficiency.
- **User Experience**: Design seamless UI with chat suggestions and logs; test for intuitiveness. Add accessibility features like voice input.
- **New Risks**: AI ethics (e.g., originality)—mitigate with transparency and user attribution. Dependency on external APIs (e.g., Klangio)—include fallbacks. Performance in large scores—optimize by batching commands.

This enhanced plan provides a robust, future-proof foundation, drawing from established tools and APIs to deliver a powerful AI assistant.
